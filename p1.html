    <h2>the brief:</h2>
    <p>
      "Take the human language instructions you received from a classmate and make execute the instructions in the p5 web editor using p5 code.  Submit your edit 'url' to share next week along with a few written reflections on human language vs. computer code"
    </p>

    <h2>reflections:</h2>
    <p>
      Computer code lacks ambiguity and nuance. Every last detail has to be clearly defined, unlike human languages, where the other person might be able to fill in the blanks when instructions are unclear. This also means that there is no room for misinterpretation of instructions, which might make it more effective than human languages in some instances.
