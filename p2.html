      <h2>
        What does Janneane's bracelet look like?
      </h2>
      <p>
        "The bracelet has a delicate chain of gold links, slightly tarnished. There are maybe eight tiny flowers, spaced out evenly between the links. The flowers are diamond-shaped, composed of 4 gems that are very light blue, almost white."
      </p>

      <h2>
        Reflections:
      </h2>
      <p>
        Janneane's descriptive language, using words like "delicate" and "tarnished" painted a detailed picture of what her lost bracelet looked like. Since the bracelet is composed of many tiny pieces repeated over and over again, it was easier to use a loop statement to "construct" the bracelet based on her description.
